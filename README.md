# Introduction

# Background

### The project works through the following questions, drawn from the data provided:

1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. What are the trends of in-demand skills for Data Analysts?
3. How well do certain companies and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Analysts? (High Demand, High Paying)

# Tools I Used
I learned to use the following tools to analyze and manipulate the data for visualization, as part of this course and project:

- **Python**: the backbone
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- **VS Code**: the workplace for writing my Python scripts and troubleshooting erros in order to refine my analysis of the available data Luke provided
- **Git & GitHub**: version control tools that allowed for sharing my work and analysis, providing the ability for further collaboration with friends and the "data nerd" community at large.
