# Introduction
My journey with Data Analytics continues with an education on Python, a skill that had been highlighted in my SQL project to understand what competencies best serve would-be data analysts as they break into the job market.

# Background
The results of my SQL project highlighted a wide range of technical skills that would serve any aspiring Data Analyst, both in their current role and if they wished to pursue new opportunities in the data industry. Alongside SQL, Python was counted in 90% of those roles which had the highest-paying salaries. Python was also shown to be in high demand for openings that required coding expertise (alongside SQL and R); the data job market values candidates that can claim proficiency with Python as part of their toolkit, which makes sense as this language can navigate data sets and produce visualizations all in one place.

The merit in becoming at least familiar with Python is clear: companies want individuals who can utilize this powerful language to gleam insights from data and share those insights with others, and this pursuit is becoming more commonplace in the data job market. 

With that understood, I began my education on Python using Luke Barousse's [Python for Data Analystics course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/python). Both the training and practice provided here are incredibly efficient, as Luke offers a valid data set he cultivated with Python to explore the data job market.

### The project works through the following questions, drawn from the data provided:

1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. What are the trends of in-demand skills for Data Analysts?
3. What is the compensation for Data Analysts' skills in the current job market?
4. What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Analysts? (High Demand, High Paying)

# Tools I Used
I learned to use the following tools to analyze and manipulate the data for visualization, as part of this course and project:

- **Python**: the backbone of my project - this is the coding language I became familiar with as a result of working through Luke's course. The libraries I used were geared towards data analytics and visualization, honing in on valuable insights gleamed from the dataset and producing different perspectives through complimentary charts.
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were the libraries that I used in manipulating and visualizing the data available via Luke's course. 
- **VS Code**: the workplace for writing my Python scripts and troubleshooting erros in order to refine my analysis of the available data Luke provided.
- **Git & GitHub**: version control tools that allowed for sharing my work and analysis, providing the ability for further collaboration with friends and the "data nerd" community at large.
